# SmartLoan Predictor

## About the Project
SmartLoan Predictor is a Machine Learning–based project designed to help banks automatically evaluate loan applications.  
It analyzes applicant details such as personal, financial, employment, and credit information to predict whether a loan should be approved or rejected, reducing manual effort, bias, and inconsistency.

## Problem Statement
Manual loan verification is:
- Time-consuming  
- Biased and inconsistent  

This leads to:
- Rejection of good customers  
- Approval of high-risk customers  

This system provides data-driven predictions before final human verification.

## Dataset
Each row in the dataset represents a loan applicant and includes:
- Personal details  
- Financial information  
- Employment details  
- Credit history  
- Loan approval status (target variable)

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts loan approval accurately and assists banks in better decision-making.
